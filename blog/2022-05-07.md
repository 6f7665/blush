CSHG now supports blog imports, you can import markdown files or html.

To import a file, use the command !impblog:\<blog\>: where blog is the directory where you keep the blog entries you want to import to the page.

If the number of pages in the folder exceeds 5, a new page will be generated.
If the current page is "index.html" the new page will be "index2.html".
The new page will show the next 5 blog entries and so on.
In the coming days some sort of linking between the pages will be added,
and the amount of blogposts per page will will be made variable when config files are added to CSHG.
